Unit Testing
- A form of automated testing where we write code to test our code.
Benefits
- Detects Bugs Early
- Facilitates Refactoring
- Improves Code Quality


A mock function is a function that imitates the behaviour of a function.

TrustWorthy Tests
- are deterministic.
- are not dependent on random data.
- are not dependent on current date/time.
- are not dependent on global state.

Static Analysis Tools
- Tools that analyze source code without executing it.

- catch potential errors early in the development process.
- enforce coding standards and best practices.
- improve code Quality
- ensure consistent code quality across the team.


prettier
npm i -D prettier
npx prettier . --write

eslint
- a popular code quality checker for javascript

- go to eslint.org and setup your eslint
- then run npx eslint .
- you will see the errors to fix
- if you want to fix errors which are fixable, run this - npx esline . --fix

also you can set the rules in eslint.config.js

typescript
- catch type-related issues at compile time
- improved code documentation
- stronger codebase with fewer runtime issues



 npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npx vitest run"
